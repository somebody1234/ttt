# The Typescript Tome
Welcome! The Typescript Tome aims to be a comprehensive guide on TypeScript features, pitfalls, tooling and more.

# Quick Links

linking to the appropriate pages in the [language reference](language-reference/).
- The [glossary](glossary) is a list of all terms.

and other advanced constructs.

# Other Resources
- [The Typescript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html)
contains a comprehensive reference on most important features.
It also contains introductory guides for beginners and people from many programming backgrounds.
  - However, it tends to be missing features from recent TypeScript releases.
- The [Mozilla Developer Network's JavaScript reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference)
has comprehensive descriptions, common pitfalls, examples, and compatibility information for the entire standard library and many web APIs.
  - It also has a [guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide) covering most language features and many builtin objects.

<!-- TODO: getting started - configuring for various toolsets, incl. vscode-only/LSP-only (no tooling) -->
